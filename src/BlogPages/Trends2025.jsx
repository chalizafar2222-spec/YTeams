                    </h2>

                        3. Voice Search Optimization
                    </h2>
                    <p className="pb-6">
                        With the rise of smart assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, voice search has become a standard part of user behavior. By 2025, more than half of online searches will be voice-based.

                    </h2>
                    <p className="pb-6">
                        Cyber threats are more sophisticated than ever, and users are increasingly aware of privacy issues. In 2025, web security is not optional—it’s essential.

                    <p className="pb-6">
                        Not every business has the resources to hire a full development team. That’s where no-code and low-code platforms come in. These tools empower entrepreneurs and marketers to build functional websites and apps without writing extensive code.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb-6">
                        But developers are still essential for scalable solutions, complex integrations, and deep customization. At YTeams, we help clients strike the right balance between quick-launch no-code solutions and custom-built applications for long-term scalability.
